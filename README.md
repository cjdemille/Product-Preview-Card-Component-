## My process

I decided to use the card component of Bootstrap to give me a head start on the layout. I used the bootstrap card framework to develop the mobile layout. Once the elements were in place, I updated the colors and fonts to fit the guidelines. Then I worked out the line spacing for the card text and the tracking for the category label of perfume. 

Then I created a the desktop card component using the elements from the mobile design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap 5
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I think the area I'd look at improving most is creating a breakpoint between the mobile and desktop views to handle tablet viewers. I also may play around with the button location on the desktop view.
